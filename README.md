## Objectives

1. `Single product` Website / `Niche website`; ✔

2. Home page with a `(header / simple navbar), banner, products, reviews, and footer`; ✔

3. Home page products will have a `maximum of 6 items/products` with relevant details; ✔

4. Products will have `buy now button` which will take the user to the `purchase page`; ✔

5. Add `one extra section` in the `home page` in addition to the 5 sections mentioned above; ✔

6. Another page on the top navigation bar named `explore` where users will see all the products. At least 10 products with `(name, description, image, price and button)`; ✔

7. The `purchase` page is a private/protected route. Page should `display detailed information` of the `item`. Also `a form` should display the `user's name` and `email address` & users will `provide address, phone number and necessary information` to complete the purchase; ✔

8. The `private route` redirects to the `login page`. After login, the user will be `redirected to the page` where he/she wanted to go to. Also `reloading the page` of a private route, the user is not `redirected to the login page`; ✔

9. Implement `email/ password (login/Register) based login` system. `After` login/register `user name, and the logout button` should appear on the header. Displaying `username on the header` is optional & so as `google, facebook, or github provider`; ✔

10. After login show in header `Dashboard` and inside a normal user will see options like `(pay, My Orders, Review, Logout)`. The `pay` page will say: Payment system coming soon; ✔

11. `My orders` page, the logged in user will see only his/her orders with `cancel/delete any order`. `Ask a confirmation message` before deleting or canceling an item; ✔

12. On the `Review` page, users should be able to add a review and that review will appear on the home age; ✔

13. Please `add one admin` with the email address: `admin@admin.com` with password: `123456`; ✔

14. An admin will not see the options like a normal user. Instead will see `(Manage All Orders, Add A Product, Make Admin, Manage Products)`; ✔

15. An Admin `can make` another user `(an admin, add a product on the add a product page)`. After adding the product, this product will appear on the `explore` page; ✔

16. `Use a database` to store information. It could be `mongodb atlas` or any other `noSQL database`. ✔

## Bonus:

1. Adding review page should have a field to `add ratings`; ✔

2. Meaningful `README.md` file both on client side and server side with `(website name, a little description, link to your live site. And at least five bullet points mentioning different features and functionality)`; ✔

3. `Responsive website` for mobile & tablet; ✔

4. Make the website `meaningful and consistent` in look and feel; ✔

5. `Clean and organized` Code; ✔

6. Use `.env file` on the `server`, `.env.local file` on the `client` to hide db user and password, etc. Also use `.gitignore file`; ✔

7. On the `Manage All Orders` page the admin will see the orders placed by every user. At the time of `placing an order`, every order will have a default `status: pending`. An admin will be able to `update the status` of the pending to `shipped status`. Also, it would be nice if you can `do one additional task` here: The admin will be able to `delete anyone's order` here. Make sure to `add a confirmation` before deleting. Please note: `delete is optional` but recommended on this page; ✔

8. On the `Manage Products` page, an admin `can delete` any of the `products`. Please make sure there is `a confirmation`. After delete that product will not appear on the `explore` page. ✔

### Optional:

1. payment gateway `(paypal or stripe or anything else)`;

4. if you implement `pagination`, you can have duplicate products
5. Implement `jwt` token. ✔
6. Manage orders page, add `more options` like: `pending, rejected, shipped`. And consider using a select `(drop down options)`. Also, once the status of an item is updated that status is reflected on the `my orders` page once the user of the order is logged in.
7. Try to use a `better looking confirmation dialogue` other than the browser's default confirm.
8. Add some `animation` while applicable. ✔
9. Please Use `icons` whenever applicable and use `fonts` (google fonts) ✔
